Use google Apps Script , Google Spreadsheet, Google Drive and Gmail, Javascript, HTML, AngularJS to realize CRUD.
1. Create a folder on My Drive, Name it
2. Go to this folder, create a Google Apps script, and name it, copy Code.gs to Code.gs tab, then create new html file named "index", and copy index.html to index.html tab
3. create a folder where for creating subfolders and replace folder id in Code.gs with this folder id
4. Create a Spreadsheet, rename first sheet to "Log", and first row set header:
   Date,	Department,	Job Number,	Product Number,	Quantity,	Status,	Check By,	Note,	Photo Link,	Report To,	User,	Permisson,	Delete
   add one sheet name "Count", and set A1 cell:"=query(Log!A1:M,"select K,count(K) where M=false and A is not null group by K",1)"

  add one sheet name "Parameters", and fill first row as:
      Dept 1	Dept 2	Dept 3
  put emails under each Dept
  finally copy id of Spreadsheet to replace xxxxxxxxxx of fisrt code in Code.gs
    var spreadsheetId = 'xxxxxxxxxx'; //"CRUD" 
5. Record level CRUD and display control, user only can Edit,Delete the records he(she) create, and also limited 5 records can be created besides deleted records
6. Display control:
